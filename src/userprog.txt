                                                        ARGUMENT PASSING
                                                        ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.




                                                        SYSTEM CALLS
                                                        ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: 
>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?


>> B5: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B7: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?
